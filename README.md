### Procedure

- **Data Processing:** This step involves downloading open source data on cancer images and preprocessing the data. The pre-processing includes grayscaling, making images the same size, getting rid of null values, balancing if need-be, and blurring/cropping images to ONLY include the lesion.

- **Contours & Binarization:** After preprocessing the dataset to include only grayscale images with lesion, this next step figures out the contours frm the grayscale images.
  
- **Algorithm Comparison:** This step is where the finished dataset is run through a sample machine learning algorithm, then the dataset is adjusted as needed to ensure results are positive. The results are then compared between unprocessed, preprocessed, and contour datasets
  
- **Github Organization & Presentation:** The results from the previous step are compiled for presentation
