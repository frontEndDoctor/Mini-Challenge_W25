### Tools & Technologies
### Procedure
- Download and preprocess the data. This includes grayscaling, making images the same size, getting rid of null values, balancing if need-be, and blurring/cropping images to ONLY include the lesion.
- Make images black and white and figure out how to track contours
- Run our finished dataset through a sample machine learning algorithm, adjust dataset as needed to ensure results are positive. Compare results between unprocessed, preprocessed, and contour datasets
- Compile results, create a clean dataset on github with a dataset card, readme, example use, and our example machine learning model. Create a PowerPoint to speak on what we learned, results, etc.
